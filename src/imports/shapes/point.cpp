    \qmlclass Point Point
    \brief The Line item represents a geometric point drawn in 3D space.
    \since 4.8
    \ingroup qt3d::qml3d::shapes
    \inherits Item3D

    The Point element in QML provides a means of drawing points in a 3D
    environment.  For example, the following QML code line at point (0,0,0).

    \code
    Point {
        location: Qt.vector3D(0,0,0)
        effect: Effect {
            color: "#aaca00"
        }
    }
    \endcode

    The Point element is part of the \c{Qt3D.Shapes} namespace,
    so the following must appear at the top of any QML file that
    references it:

    \code
    import Qt3D.Shapes 1.0
    \endcode

    \sa Item3D

    QDeclarativeItem3D(parent)
    , m_location(QVector3D(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f))
    , m_pointSize(1.0f)
{
    //meh
}


/*!
    \qmlproperty QVector3D Point::location

    This property defines the locaiton of the point to be drawn.
    The default value is (0,0,0).

void Point::setLocation(QVector3D location)
{
    if (m_location != location) {
        m_location = location;
        emit locationChanged();
        update();
    }
}

/*!

        m_pointSize = pointSize;
        emit pointSizeChanged();

    }
}
