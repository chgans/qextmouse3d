    \qmlproperty real FloatingItem::depth

    This property defines the depth within the 3D field where children
    of this item will appear.  The default value of zero indicates
    that the left and right eye images will co-incide at the center of
    focus.

    If the value is non-zero, then it indicates the number of pixels that
    separate the left and right eye images.  A negative value places
    the item behind the center of focus and a positive value places
    the item in front of the center of focus.
