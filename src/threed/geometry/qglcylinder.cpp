    \class QGLCylinder
    \brief The QGLCylinder class represents the geometry of a simple cylinder/cone in 3D space.
    \since 4.8
    \ingroup qt3d
    \ingroup qt3d::geometry

    The following example creates a cone with a top diameter of 1 unit,
    a bottom diameter of  of 2 units in diameter and height of 3 units.

    It then draws it at (10, 25, 0) in a QGLPainter:

    \code
    QGLBuilder builder;
    builder << QGLCylinder(1.0,2.0,3.0);
    QGLSceneNode *node = builder.finalizedSceneNode();

    painter.translate(10, 25, 0);
    node->draw(&painter);
    \endcode;

    Note that the bottom circle of the cylinder will always be centred at (0,0,0)
    unless otherwise transformed after cylinder creation.

    The QGLCylinder class specifies positions, normals and 2D texture
    co-ordinates for all of the vertices that make up the cylinder.

    The texture co-ordinates are fixed at construction time.  This
    is because constructing the cylinder can involve generating additional
    vertices which need to interpolate the texture co-ordinates of their
    neighboring vertices.

    The QGLCylinder is divided into slices and layers.  The slices value
    indicate number of triangular sections into which the top and bottom
    circles of the cylinder are broken into.  Consequently it also sets the
    number of facets which run the length of the cylinder.  More slices 
    results in a smoother circumference.

    The layers value indicates the number of longitudinal sections the
    cylinder is broken into.  Fewer layers means that the side facets of the
    cylinder will be made up of fewer, very long, triangles, while a higher
    number of layers will produce many and smaller triangles.  Often it is
    desirable to avoid large triangles as they may cause inefficiencies in
    texturing/lighting on certain platforms.

    The end-caps and sides of the cylinder are independent sections of the
    scene-graph, and so may be textured separately.

    Textures are wrapped around the sides of thecylinder in such a way that 
    the texture may distort across the x axis if the top and bottom diameters 
    of the cylinder differ (ie. the cylinder forms a truncated cone).  Textures 
    begin and end at the centre points of the top and bottom end-caps of the
    cylinder.  This wrapping means that textures on either end-cap may be
    distorted.

    Texture coordinates are assigned as shown below.

    \image cylinder-texture-coords.png   

    It is worth noting that the cylinder class can, in fact, be used to generate
    any regular solid polygonal prism.  A rectangular prism can be created, for 
    example, by creating a 4 sided cylinder.  Likewise a hexagonal prism is 
    simply a 6 sided cylinder.

    With this knowledge, and an understanding of the texture coordinate mapping,
    it is possible to make custom textures which will be usable with these 
    three dimensional objects.

    Constructs the geometry for a cylinder with top of diameter \a diameterTop,
    a base of diameter \a diameterBase, and a height of \a height.

    The resultant mesh will be divided around the vertical axis of the cylinder
    into \a slices individual wedges, and shall be formed of \a layers stacked
    to form the cylinder.

    If the values for \a top or \a base are true, then the cylinder will be 
    created with solid endcaps.  Otherwise, it shall form a hollow pipe.
