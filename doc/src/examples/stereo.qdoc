    \title Stereo Viewing Example

    The Stereo example shows how to view objects in "stereoscopic 3D" with
    the use of red-cyan viewing glasses, polarized classes, or
    side-by-side rendering.

    The example is pretty much the same as the \l{qt3d-examples.html}{other
    examples}, with one small modification to camera initialization:

    \snippet stereo/stereoview.cpp 1

    By setting the QGLCamera::eyeSeparation property to a non-zero value,
    we indicate that we want the \c{paintGL()} function to be called twice.
    The first time, the camera on the QGLPainter is set slightly offset
    for the left eye, and the second time the camera is set slightly offset
    for the right eye.

    The QGLView class supports a number of stereoscopic viewing modes.
    The screenshot above shows the default red-cyan anaglyph mode.
    If the QGLView::stereoType() is changed to QGLView::DoubleWideLeftRight,
    then the two eye images will be rendered side by side:

    See the \l{QGLView#Stereo viewing support}{stereo viewing support} 
    section in the QGLView documentation for more information on the
    stereoscopic viewing modes that are supported.

    The \l{QML Stereo Viewing Example}{QML version} of the stereo
    example provides a richer experience, including the mixing of
    2D and 3D scene elements within a stereo viewing field:
