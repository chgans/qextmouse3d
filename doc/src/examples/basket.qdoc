    \title Basket Example

    \section2 Basket in C++

    The Basket example shows how Qt/3D can be used to draw an animated
    object covered in a texture.  The basic application shell is similar
    to the \l{teapot}{Hello Teapot} example.  In this case, we create
    the basket object and add a texture to it as follows:

    \snippet basket/basketview.cpp 1

    For this animation, we want to spin the basket around its Y axis,
    once every 2 seconds.  We first declare an \c angle property in the
    class declaration (calling \c{update()} will force the view to
    redraw whenever the angle changes):

    \snippet basket/basketview.h 1

    Then we create a QPropertyAnimation object that will update
    \c angle every time through the event loop with a new value
    between 0 and 360 degrees:

    \snippet basket/basketview.cpp 2

    Now all we have to do is draw the basket using the \c angle
    property every time \c{paintGL()} is called:

    \snippet basket/basketview.cpp 3

    \section2 Basket in QML/3D

    The QML/3D version of the basket example is very similar in
    structure to the C++ version above, but much simpler.
    We start by defining a viewport with a specific camera position:

    \snippet declarative/basket.qml 1

    We then add an \l Item3D object to load the basket model and
    apply the desired texture to it:

    \snippet declarative/basket.qml 2

    And then we apply an animation to the rotation component of
    the item's transform property:

    \snippet declarative/basket.qml 3
