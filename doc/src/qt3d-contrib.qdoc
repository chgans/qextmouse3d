    \title Contributing to Qt/3D
    \keyword Contributing to Qt/3D

    Qt/3D is being developed primarily in the Brisbane office of Qt
    Development Frameworks, but anyone is welcome to join the effort with
    patches, new examples, and major feature development.

    Contact Rhys Weatherley in the Brisbane office for more information
    on how you can contribute to Qt/3D.

    Because Qt/3D may eventually become part of Qt, all contributions
    need to conform with the
    \l{http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/pages/QtContributionGuidelines}{Qt Contribution Model Guidelines}.

    The source for Qt/3D is hosted on Gitorious at
    \l{http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/qt3d}.

    Bugs can be reported against the "Qt3D" component of the "Qt" project
    at \l{http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/}.

    The Qt/3D project has an open mailing list, which can be subscribed
    to at \l{http://lists.trolltech.com/mailman/listinfo/qt-3d}.
