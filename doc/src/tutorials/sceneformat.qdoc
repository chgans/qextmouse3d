    \title Writing a scene format plug-in for Qt/3D
    \example sceneformats/obj

    Scene format plugins are used to load external 3D model file
    formats like \bold 3DS, \bold obj, and so on.  In this tutorial we will
    do a walk-through of the \bold obj scene format plugin to
    demonstrate what is required to add a new format to Qt/3D.

    Models are loaded by QGLAbstractScene::loadScene(), which locates
    a suitable plug-in for the format, and then asks the plug-in to
    parse the data and create a QGLAbstractScene object that describes
    the 3D objects in the scene.

    We start by declaring an instance of QGLSceneFormatPlugin and
    arranging for it to be registered with the Qt plug-in system:

    \snippet sceneformats/obj/main.cpp 1
    \snippet sceneformats/obj/main.cpp 4

    The two functions we need to implement are
    \l{QGLSceneFormatPlugin::keys()}{keys()} and
    \l{QGLSceneFormatPlugin::create()}{create()}.  The first of these
    returns a lower-case list of the file extensions and MIME types
    that are supported by the plug-in:

    \snippet sceneformats/obj/main.cpp 2

    The create function is called to create the QGLSceneFormatHandler
    which is used to load the model data:

    \snippet sceneformats/obj/main.cpp 3

    The create function is passed the QIODevice for the data,
    the URL of where the data was found, and the chosen format.
    These parameters can be used by the plug-in to decide which
    handler to return if multiple formats are supported by
    the plug-in.  In the case of obj, we always return the same
    handler so we don't need to inspect the passed parameters.

    QGLAbstractScene::loadScene() will set the parameters on
    the QGLSceneFormatHandler object and then call
    \l{QGLSceneFormatHandler::read()}{read()}:

    \snippet sceneformats/obj/qglobjscenehandler.h 1
    \dots
    \snippet sceneformats/obj/qglobjscenehandler.h 2

    The read function will typically construct a QGLDisplayList
    for the geometry in the scene and then parse all of the objects,
    materials, textures, and so on.  Ultimately, it needs to produce a
    QGLAbstractScene object, populated with QGLSceneNode instances
    for each of the objects in the model file.  In our case, we create
    an instance of \c QGLObjScene:

    \snippet sceneformats/obj/qglobjscene.h 1
    \dots
    \snippet sceneformats/obj/qglobjscene.h 2
    \dots
    \snippet sceneformats/obj/qglobjscene.h 3

    The most important function is the override for
    QGLAbstractScene::objects(), which allows the rest of Qt/3D
    to query the full list of objects in the model file.
    The scene object can also override QGLAbstractScene::object()
    if it has an efficient method to quickly look up an object by name.

    Note: the plug-in does not need to use QGLDisplayList and the
    other Qt/3D classes to load the model if it doesn't want to.
    It can instantiate subclasses of QGLSceneNode that override
    the draw() method and draws the object using whatever technique
    the plug-in chooses.  It just needs to leave the OpenGL state
    in the condition that it found it so that other parts of Qt/3D
    will not be confused.

    Once you have written a plug-in for your new format, you should
    install it into \c{$QTDIR/plugins/sceneformats}.  You can test it
    by running the \c{modelviewer} program and trying to load models
    in your new format.  When debugging, it can be useful to set the
    \c{QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS} environment variable to 1.
