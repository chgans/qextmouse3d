    \title Tea Service Demo

    The Tea Service demo shows how Qt/3D can be used to draw a complex
    scene made up of several objects.  It also demonstrates object picking.

    There is also a \l{Tea Service Demo in QML}{QML version} of the
    Tea Service demo which has more advanced object picking, animations,
    states, and transitions.  It is much easier to add complex
    interaction models and animations in QML than in C++.
