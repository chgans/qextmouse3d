This directory contains a 3D mouse plug-in that supports the
"Magellan" X11 protocol for mice from 3Dconnexion.

The "3dxsrv" driver must be running on the X server before a
Qt/3D application that uses the 3D mouse is executed.  The driver
can be obtained here:

    http://www.3dconnexion.com/service/drivers.html

If you are using a SpaceNavigator, it is recommended that you use
the "3dxsrv" driver's UI to configure the button mappings as follows:

    L           Translations
    R           Rotations

If you are using a SpacePilot PRO, it is recommended that you use
the "3dxsrv" driver's UI to configure the button mappings as follows:

    Menu        Custom 1                4       Button 4
    Fit         Custom 2                5       Button 5
    T           Button 11               6       Button 6
    L           Button 12               7       Button 7
    R           Button 13               8       Button 8
    F           Button 14               9       Button 9
    B           Button 15               10      Button 10
    BK          Button 16               Esc     Esc Key
    Roll +      Custom 3                Alt     Alt Key
    Roll -      Custom 4                Shift   Shift Key
    ISO 1       Custom 5                Ctrl    Ctrl Key
    ISO 2       Custom 6                Rot     Rotations
    1           Button 1                Tran    Translations
    2           Button 2                Dom     Dominant Axis
    3           Button 3                +       Increase Sensitivity
                                        -       Decrease Sensitivity

Also make sure that the custom keys are mapped as follows (this is
usually the default in "3dxsrv"):

    Custom 1    <Control_L><Shift_L><Alt_L><F1>
    Custom 2    <Control_L><Shift_L><Alt_L><F2>
    Custom 3    <Control_L><Shift_L><Alt_L><F3>
    Custom 4    <Control_L><Shift_L><Alt_L><F4>
    Custom 5    <Control_L><Shift_L><Alt_L><F5>

Save the configuration so that the buttons will be automatically mapped
this way every time your Qt/3D application is executed.
