This directory contains a 3D mouse plug-in that uses the Linux
/dev/input interface to get events from a 3D mouse.

The appropriate Linux kernel driver must be loaded and working, and the
device node must have its permissions set so that the application can
open the input device.

The following devices have been tested:

    - 3Dconnexion SpacePilot PRO
            http://www.3dconnexion.com/products/spacepilot-pro.html
    - 3Dconnexion SpaceNavigator
            http://www.3dconnexion.com/products/spacenavigator.html

Please forward any information and patches for other /dev/input based
devices to the Qt/3D development team.
