This directory contains a prototype 3D API and examples for Qt 4.6 or later.

Run qmake and then make to build it against your favourite version of Qt.
You will need to have built Qt with the "-opengl" option.  Run "make install"
afterwards to install the plugins into your Qt build.

Note: a build tree for Qt is required, not the SDK version of Qt.
The SDK version of Qt lacks the private headers that are needed to
build some parts of Qt/3D.

Directory structure:

threed/
    This is the main library of the Qt/3D project, containing abstractions
    for cross-platform GL, shaders, lighting models, and so on.
util/
    Contains the "meshcvt" utility, for converting raw bezier and triangle
    meshes into a form that can be loaded as static const data.
plugins/
    Scene format loading plugins.
examples/
    Some examples of using the Qt/3D library.
demos/
    More complex demos of Qt/3D, including QML/3D for integrating
    Qt/3D with the Declarative UI component of Kinetic.
tests/
    Unit tests for the Math3D and Qt/3D libraries.
doc/
    Documentation.

The documentation can be generated with "make docs".  It will be placed
into "doc/html" in the build directory.
