    \class TriPlane
    \brief The TriPlane class holds a 3D model of a large flat plane.
    When drawing a large flat plane, such as a wall or a floor, it is desirable
    to decompose it into smaller units to make the shading effects look correct.
    This class composes a plane out of a configurable number of triangles.
    The plane works no matter what the orientation or size.
*/

/*!
    Construct a new TriPlane with the specified parameters.
    The TriPlane lies in the infinite plane specified by \a plane.  This
    means that the TriPlane has the same normal everywhere as \a plane, and
    the sides of the TriPlane are determined relative to the origin of \a plane.

    The \a side vector specifies the orientation of the rectangular TriPlane,
    and the \a size specifies the TriPlanes dimensions.  The default size
    is 100.0f x 100.0f.  The resulting TriPlane is a rectangle, \a size
    in dimension, centered on the origin of the \a plane, and aligned to the
    \a side vector.  The side vector is projected onto the plane first in case
    it does not lie in the plane.  Specifying a side vector that is aligned to
    the normal of \a plane is an error and leads to undefined behaviour.

    The side vector can be understood this way: if the TriPlane is a vertical
    wall, then the side vector is an "up" vector, parallel to the two vertical
    edges of the wall.  The TriPlane will be divided up by halving lengthwise
    and widthwise \a level times.  Level is clamped to a max of 8 (256
    divisions) and min of 1 (2 divisions).

    The TriPlane sets its boundingBox() so that redundant drawing operations
    are elided.
