/*!
    \class QuadPlane
    \brief The QuadPlane class holds a 3D model of a large flat plane.
    When drawing a large flat plane, such as a wall or a floor, it is desirable
    to decompose it into smaller units to make the shading effects look correct.
    This class composes a plane out of a configurable number of quads.
*/

/*!
    Construct a new QuadPlane with \a size, subdivided \a level times.  By default
    the plane is 100.0f x 100.0f, and is subdivided 3 times - that is into an
    8 x 8 grid.

    It is centered on the origin, and lies in the z = 0 plane.
