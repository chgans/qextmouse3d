This directory contains useful scripts and resources for use when
using Qt3D on devices.

In the case of devices/n900 the following commands can be used to get a
set of clickable application launch icons on the N900's apps screen:

cd $DEPOT/qt3d/devices
scp -r n900/* root@192.168.2.15:/.
cd $BUILD/qt3d
scp -r bin/* root@192.168.2.15:/opt/qt3d/bin
