    \qmlclass Cube Cube
    \brief The Cube item represents a simple cube in 3D space.
    \since 4.8
    \ingroup qt3d::qml3d
    \inherits Item3d

    The Cube element in QML provides a simple way to create a cube
    object, usually for testing material effects.  For example,
    the following QML code displays a cube of size 1.5, centered
    on the origin and covered in the Qt logo texture:

    \code
    Cube {
        size: 1.5
        effect: Effect {
            color: "#aaca00"
            texture: "qtlogo.png"
        }
    }
    \endcode

    The cube can be moved from the origin by specifying the
    Item3d::position property:

    \code
    Cube {
        size: 1.5
        position: Qt.vector3d(1, 0, 5)
        effect: Effect {
            color: "#aaca00"
            texture: "qtlogo.png"
        }
    }
    \endcode

    \sa Item3d
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty real Cube::size

    The size of the cube.  The default value for this property is 1.
    The cube will be centered on Item3d::position.
*/
