    \class QGLHeightMap
    \brief The QGLHeightMap class is a convenience class designed to make it easy to create a simple 2D surface in 3D space.
    \since 4.6
    \ingroup painting-3D

    Many 3D objects can be conviently thought of as a 2D object in a 3D space,
    such as flags, sheets of paper, mirrors, etc.

    It can be very helpful when learning about 3D programming to easily create
    and manipulate these in isolation before moving on to more complicated
    objects that might involve many different surfaces used in many different
    ways.

    QGLHeightMap makes it easy to create and draw simple height maps.  The
    surfaces created are characterised by being composed of vertices spaced
    equally between 0.0 and 1.0 in the x and y dimensions, but varying in the
    z dimension.  After creation, general 3D functions can be used to
    manipulate these surfaces into any desired orientation or scale.

    The surfaces that QGLHeightMap creates are smooth, with each vertex having
    a normal that is the average of all faces that the vertex is part of.

    Assuming that an appropriate QGLContext or QGLView is available, a
    heightmap can be created and drawn immediately with the QGLGeometry::draw()
    function.  Calculating the vertexes is expensive, however, and it is not
    recommend that a QGLHeightMap be recreated every update.

    The default implementation creates a flat plane, where the every vertex
    lies in the plane z = 0.0, with vertex and texture coordinates spaced
    evenly across that plane.

    For example, the QGLHeightMap(11, 11) would be a flat plane in the
    x,y dimension with vertices at x= [0.0, 0.1, 0.2... 0.9, 1.0] and
    y=[0.0, 0.1, 0.2 ... , 0.9, 1.0], with a z value of 0.0 for all vertexes,
    and tex coords for each vertex equal to that vertexes x and y values.

    The default behaviour can be altered by overriding the calculation
    functions in a subclass, allowing for a variety of surfaces.

    For example, a ripple-like effect, centered on the middle of the the
    heightmap might look like:
    \code
    #include <qglheightmap.h>
    #include <QtCore/qmath.h>
    #include "math.h"
    #define PI 3.141592

    class MyHeightMap : public QGLHeightMap
    {
    public:
        MyHeightMap(int xPoints, int yPoints) : QGLHeightMap(xPoints,yPoints){};
        float height(float s, float t)
        {
            return 0.1 * cos( 5 * 2.0 * PI * sqrt((s - 0.5) * (s - 0.5) + (t - 0.5) * (t - 0.5)))
        }
    };
    \endcode

    \sa QGLGeometry, height(), calculateTexCoords()

/*!
    \fn QGLHeightMap::QGLHeightMap(int xPoints, int yPoints)

    Constructs a QGLHeightMap with the specified number of vertexes across
    each dimension, and calculates all vertex and normal information.  The
    total number of vertexes will therefor be \a xPoints * \a yPoints, with floating
    point calculations for each normal on top of the actual height function.

    Beware the memory and performance implications of large numbers or points.

    It is not valid for a QGLHeightMap to have 0 or less points in either
    dimension.

    This function creates the vertex and index array and assigns them to the

    More specifically, it generates the position texture coordinates for each
    vertexes in the heightmap, then calculates the indexes for the triangles
    and the normals for the vertexes.

    The normals are calculated using the average of the normals of the
    faces that a given vertex is part of, resulting in a smooth mesh.

  \fn calculateTexCoord(float s, float t)

    This function returns the tex coord for a given vertex.  Reimplement this
    function in a subclass to change the way texCoords are calculated.

    The default implementation sets the tex coords to (s,t) for each vertex.
    This should give a good effect in most cases, but may cause distortion if
    there is a large variance in z.

    The potential problem should be made clear with this example: Consider a heightmap with 11*11 vertecies that is mostly flat,
    but with the rightmost set of points (t == 1.0) raised by the width of the heightmap.  The one set of quads on the rightmost
    edge will cover a comparable area as the rest of the quads in that row combined, but will have the same amount of texture data
    as only one of them spread over that area.  This is likely to look bad.

    This class is not well suited to solving this problem, but may provide a
    useful example while developing one that is.
