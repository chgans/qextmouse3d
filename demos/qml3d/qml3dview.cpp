    \class Qml3dView
    \brief The Qml3dView class is based on the QMLView class, and is intended to allow for the
    display of 3d imagery specified in QML/3d.  The Qml3dView takes the place of its parent class
    and contains provisions for display and management of \l Item3d objects, as well as \l Effect
    objects and related classes.

    \section1 Defining an Qml3dView

    In standard QML the QMLView provides a means of displaying QML items and their supporting
    effects and animations.  For the purposes of 3d display of QML defined items, a more specific
    class is needed which caters to the needs of a Qt3d environment.

    Using the Qml3dView is extremely simple. Consider the code below:

    \code
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        QApplication app(argc, argv);

        QString source = argv[index];

        QUrl url(source);
        QFileInfo fi(source);
        if (fi.exists())
            url = QUrl::fromLocalFile(fi.absoluteFilePath());

        Qml3dView view;
        view.setSource(url);
        view.show();

        return app.exec();
    }
    \endcode

    This is a relatively simple example which shows how easy it can be to use the Qml3dView class.

    The user need only define a source URL, then call the setSource() and the show() functions.

    Internally the class sets the necessary parameters and functions for OpenGL activities, as
    well as user interaction through picking and mouse actions.  Initialisation of scene elements
    and other 3d components is also carried out within the Qml3dView.
