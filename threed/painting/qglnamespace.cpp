           QGL::Color vertex array with no lighting.
    \value FlatReplaceTexture2D Map a texture across the fragments with

           QGLPainter::setFaceMaterial() with lighting enabled.  It is
           assumed that per-vertex normals are provided.  Under OpenGL/ES 2.0
           only one light is supported.
    \value LitDecalTexture2D Map a texture across the fragments, combined
           with the material color specified by QGLPainter::setFaceMaterial(),
           and lighting using the GL_DECAL combination rule.  The texture is
           sourced from texture unit 0.  It is assumed that per-vertex

           supported.
    \value LitModulateTexture2D Map a texture across the fragments, combined
           with the material color specified by QGLPainter::setFaceMaterial(),
           and lighting using the GL_MODULATE combination rule.  The texture

        and then use the value that is nearest the pixel being textured.
    \value NearestMipmapLinear Choose the two mipmaps that most closely
        match the final pixel size, select a pixel from each using the
        Nearest criteria, and then produce the linear weighted average
        of those two values.
    \value LinearMipmapNearest Choose the mipmap that is nearest in size
        and then use the linear weighted average of the nearby pixels.
    \value LinearMipmapLinear Choose the two mipmaps that most closely

        Linear criteria, and then produce the linear weighted average

*/

/*!
    \enum QGL::TextureWrap
    \since 4.7
    This enum defines the wrapping mode for texture co-ordinates.

    \value Repeat Ignore the integer part of the texture co-ordinate and
        create a repeating pattern using the texture.
    \value Clamp Clamps the texture co-ordinate to the range 0 to 1.
        This value is not supported in OpenGL/ES, where it will be
        treated the same as ClampToEdge.
    \value ClampToBorder Clamps the texture co-ordinate to the range
        (-1 / 2N) to (1 + 1 / 2N) where N is the size of the texture in
        the direction of clamping.  This value is supported in OpenGL 1.3
        and higher.  In OpenGL versions less than 1.3, this value will
        be treated the same as Clamp.  In OpenGL/ES, this value will be
        treated the same as ClampToEdge.
    \value ClampToEdge Clamps the texture co-ordinate to the range
        (1 / 2N) to (1 - 1 / 2N) where N is the size of the texture in
        the direction of clamping.  This value is supported in OpenGL 1.2
        and higher, and in all versions of OpenGL/ES.  In OpenGL versions
        less than 1.2, this value will be treated the same as Clamp.
    \value MirroredRepeat If the integer part of the texture co-ordinate
        is even, then use the fractional part.  If the integer part of
        the texture co-ordinate is odd, then use 1 - the fractional part.
        This creates an alternating repeating pattern from the texture.
        This value is only supported in OpenGL 1.4 and higher, or
        OpenGL/ES 2.0 and higher.  On other versions, MirroredRepeat
        will be treated the same as Repeat.

    \value NoClearBuffers No buffers should be cleared.
    \value ClearDepthBuffer Clears the depth buffer.
    \value ClearStencilBuffer Clears the stencil buffer.
    \value ClearColorBuffer Clears the color buffer.
*/

    \relates QGLDisplayList

    This enum defines vertex smoothing treatments.
    \value NoSmoothing No smoothing processing is performed.
    \value Smooth Lighting normals averaged for each face for a smooth appearance.
    \value Faceted Lighting normals seperate for each face for a faceted appearance.
