  \class QLine3D
  \brief The QLine3D class models the mathematics of lines in 3D space.
  \since 4.7
  \ingroup qt3d
  \ingroup qt3d::math

  A line is defined by:

  \list
  \o a point, which can be thought of as an origin point.
  \o a direction vector, giving the heading of the line from the point.
  \endlist

  A line is infinite.

  It can be thought of as a one-dimensional co-ordinate system.  If the single
  co-ordinate is \bold t then the system has the \bold origin point, where
  \c{t == 0.0f}, and the \bold direction vector pointing in the direction of
  increasing values of the t-coordinate.

  Construct a line with QLine3D(const QVector3D &origin, const QVector3D &direction)
  where direction is a non-null vector, and origin is a point.

  If a null vector is supplied for direction, then the \bold {behaviour of the QLine3D is undefined}.

  The default constructor for QLine3D() arbitrarily chooses \c{(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)} as
  the direction vector.

  The point() method returns a point at the tip of a ray from the origin, lying on the
  line, where the length of the ray is the amount \bold t.  The sign of \bold t
  distinguishes which direction (same or opposite) the ray points, with respect to
  the direction vector.

  Another way to think of this, is that the point() method allows for parametric
  generation of all points on the line, as \bold t varies from negative infinity
  to positive infinity.

  \code
    QLine3D cameraAxis(objectCenter, viewingOrientation);
    QVector3D viewPoint = line.point(viewingDistance);
    QVector3D cameraVector = -viewingOrientation;
  \endcode

  From this definition it can be seen that this primitive is in fact a line (not a ray
  or a line-segment), since t can take on infinitely many positive or negative values.

  For more details of the math of QLine3D see \l {3D Math Basis}
 */

/*!
  \fn QLine3D::QLine3D()
  Construct a default QLine3D with a defining point at the origin.
  The direction vector cannot be the null vector and is thus set to a
  unit vector on the X-axis.
 */

/*!
  \fn QLine3D::QLine3D(const QVector3D &origin, const QVector3D &direction)
  Construct a QLine3D given its defining \a origin and \a direction.

  If the direction vector is null, then behaviour is undefined.

  To construct a line that passes through two given points, use this code:
  \code
  QLine3D thruAB(pointA, pointB - pointA);
  \endcode

  If you want a finite line, which starts at A and ends at B, use the
  QLineSegment class.

  Returns the origin of this line as a QVector3D point.

 */

/*!
  \fn QVector3D QLine3D::direction() const
  Returns the direction vector of this line.
 */

/*!
  \fn void QLine3D::setDirection(const QVector3D &direction)
  Sets the direction vector of this line to \a direction.

  If the direction vector is null, then behaviour of the QLine3D is \bold undefined.
 */

/*!
  \fn bool QLine3D::contains(const QVector3D &point) const
  Returns true if the \a point given lies on this line; and false otherwise.
 */

/*!
  \fn bool QLine3D::contains(const QLine3D &line) const
  Returns true if the \a line lies on this line; and false otherwise.  If true,
  this implies that the two lines are the same line, however they may define
  different 1D coordinate systems in that they may have different origin points,
  and the direction may be inverted.

  Calculates the intersection of this line with the given \a line.
  If this line and the given \a line do not intersect, then the
  QResult<QVector3D> returned will return false from QResult<QVector3D>::isValid(),

  In this example the intersection() function is used to find if a point is
  inside a triangle:

  return base.distanceFromOrigin(proj) <= base.distanceFromOrigin(m_q) &&
            apexToPoint.distanceFromOrigin(point) <= apexToPoint.distanceFromOrigin(proj);

  If the direction vector of either this or \a line is null, then
  QResult::InvalidArgument is returned.

  the direction vector.

  Consider vector V as the sum of two perpendicular vectors: \c{V = V' + V''}
  then project(V) gives V', the component of V in the direction of this line.
  V'' is the component of V which is perpendicular to this line.

  Imagine a 3D model of a robotic arm lifting a weight in uniform gravity.
  The effort applied by the fore-arm of the robot depends on the angle of the
  forearm compared to the down-vector:
  \code
    QLine3D forearm(elbowSite, forearmOrientation);
    QVector3D gravityForce = forearm.project(worldModel->getDownVector());

  to this line which passes through the point.

/*!
  \fn qreal QLine3D::distanceFromOrigin(const QVector3D &point) const
  Returns the distance of a \a point from the origin of this line.  There is
  no test that the point is on the line: this function is exactly equivalent to:
  \code
  QVector3D vec = point - line.origin();
  myDistanceFromOrigin = vec.length();

  If the point is known to be on the line, then this method is the inverse of
  the point(qreal t) function.
