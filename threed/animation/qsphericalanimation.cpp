    \class QSphericalAnimation
    \brief The QSphericalAnimation class animates objects rotating around a point on the surface of a sphere.
    \ingroup qt3d
    \ingroup qt3d::enablers

    The animation occurs along a circular path on surface of a sphere
    centered at origin().  The start, end, and key values must be
    QVector3D instances indicating the points along the path.

    This class can also animate along an elliptical path by adjusting
    the points to define a curve with a longer axis in one direction.

    Due to the quaternion-based algorithm used, the key values must
    be separated by less than 180 degrees.  The algorithm will always
    choose the shortest path between two key values, which can never
    be greater than or equal to 180 degrees.

    For a full circle (or ellipse), it is recommended that 5 key values
    be provided for the 0, 90, 180, 270, and 360 degree positions
    (where the 360 degree position is the same as 0).  The following
    example demonstrates this for a circle of radius 3 in the
    z = 0 plane around the origin:

    \code
    qreal radius = 3.0f;
    animPlanet1 = new QSphericalAnimation(this, "planet1Pos", this);
    animPlanet1->setStartValue(qVariantFromValue(QVector3D(radius, 0.0f, 0.0f)));
    animPlanet1->setKeyValueAt(0.25f, qVariantFromValue(QVector3D(0.0f, radius, 0.0f)));
    animPlanet1->setKeyValueAt(0.5f, qVariantFromValue(QVector3D(-radius, 0.0f, 0.0f)));
    animPlanet1->setKeyValueAt(0.75f, qVariantFromValue(QVector3D(0.0f, -radius, 0.0f)));
    animPlanet1->setEndValue(qVariantFromValue(QVector3D(radius, 0.0f, 0.0f)));
    animPlanet1->setDuration(3000);
    animPlanet1->setLoopCount(-1);
    animPlanet1->start();
    \endcode
