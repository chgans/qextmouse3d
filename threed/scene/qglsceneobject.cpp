    \enum QGLSceneObject::Type
    This enum defines the type of scene object represented by a QGLSceneObject instance.

    \value Camera Defines a projection for the scene.
    \value Effect Defines a specific material, shader, or texture.
    \value Light Defines a light in the scene.
    \value Main Defines a main object of interest in the scene.
           There may be multiple main objects.
    \value Mesh Defines a geometry mesh.
    \value World Defines an entire scene world.  World objects are usually
           the top-level, or "root", objects in a scene.

    before a geometry mesh is drawn, and then cleaned up afterwards.

    the QGLPainter::modelViewMatrix() and then adjust the modelview for
    the object's scale, orientation, and position.  In cleanup(), the
    original modelview is restored with QGLMatrixStack::pop().
