    \class QGLAbstractScene
    \brief The QGLAbstractScene class represents a 3D scene consisting of zero or more QGLSceneNode instances.
    \since 4.8
    \ingroup qt3d
    \ingroup qt3d::scene

    Scenes are typically created by 3D modelling packages and then loaded
    into the application via a QGLSceneFormatPlugin; but they can also be
    constructed programatically.  The functions in this
    class provide access to major scene objects so that they can be
    applied or drawn whenever the application decides.

    QGLAbstractScene presents a very simple model of a 3D scene.  Subclasses
    implement the specific scene graph and object representations in a
    manner specific to the package's format.  Subclasses may also provide
    functionality to create new objects at runtime, but this is not required.

    The scene is defined to consist of a number of important objects
    of the following types:

    \list
    \o Camera objects define a viewing position in world-coordinates and a
       projection that maps 3D world co-ordinates to 2D screen co-ordinates.
       It is recommended that camera objects inherit from QGLCamera.
    \o Main objects designate the major elements of the scene besides
       cameras, lights, and effects.
    \o Light objects define positions and parameters for lighting the scene.
       It is recommended that light objects inherit from QGLLightParameters.
    \o Effect objects define materials, shaders, and textures for use in
       rendering the surface of objects.  Normally effects are activated
       automatically when main objects are drawn.  But effects can be used
       independently if the 3D format is acting as a library of effects.
    \o Mesh objects define geometry information independently of effects.
       Normally meshes are drawn automatically with an appropriate effect
       when main objects are drawn.  But meshes can be used independently
       if the 3D format is acting as a library of meshes.
    \o World objects define collections of objects such that the entire
       scene can be drawn just by drawing the World object.
    \endlist

    Typically, the full scene represented by the World object is not
    interesting to the application.  3D modelling packages regularly
    insert cameras, lights, effects, and other library objects that
    are useful to the modelling package, but not the application.
    The Main objects are usually the most interesting to applications.

    QGLAbstractScene makes it easy to access the major scene elements
    with object(), objects(), and defaultObject().

    There are many other kinds of objects in the scene that may not
    be accessible via QGLAbstractScene because they are not considered
    "important" enough.  For example, a file that contains the data
    for a skateboard object would contain many objects for the board,
    wheels, texturing effects, animations, and so on.  The application
    may only be interested in the skateboard as a whole, and not its
    sub-components.  The skateboard would be considered an important
    Main object in this case, which can be easily accessed and
    incorporated into the application's logic.

    Each Subclass needs to provide its own policy for deciding which
    objects are considered "important".

    the data in \a device so that relative resources can be located.

    The \a options string is passed to the underlying format loader
    and its meaning and format depend on the loader.  For example the
    format string for the .3ds loader accepts the following options:
    \list
    \o ForceSmooth - average normals for a smooth appearance
    \o ForceFaceted - per face normals for a faceted appearance
    \o NativeIndices - map native indices for poorly smoothed models
    \o CorrectNormals - fix inverted normals on models with bad windings
    \o CorrectAcute - fix normals on models that smooth acute angles
    \endlist

    The options may be specified globally for the whole model, or just
    for a particular mesh.

    In this example smoothing is forced on globally, and native indices
    are used on just the mesh called "BattCoverMesh".
