    \class QGLBuilder
    \brief The QGLBuilder class constructs geometry for efficient display.
    \since 4.8
    \ingroup qt3d
    \ingroup qt3d::geometry

    \tableofcontents

    Use a QGLBuilder to build up vertex, index, texture and other data
    during application initialization.  The finalizedSceneNode() function
    returns an optimized scene which can be efficiently and flexibly
    displayed during frames of rendering.  It is suited to writing loaders
    for 3D models, and also for programatically creating geometry.

    \section1 Geometry Building

    The simplest way to use QGLBuilder is to send a set of geometry
    values to it using QGeometryData in the constructor:

    \code
    MyView::MyView() : QGLView()
    {
        // in the constructor construct a builder on the stack
        QGLBuilder builder;
        QGeometryData triangle;
        QVector3D a(2, 2, 0);
        QVector3D b(-2, 2, 0);
        QVector3D c(0, -2, 0);
        triangle.appendVertex(a, b, c);

        // When adding geometry, QGLBuilder automatically creates lighting normals
        builder << triangle;

        // obtain the scene from the builder
        m_scene = builder.finalizedSceneNode();

        // apply effects at app initialization time
        QGLMaterial *mat = new QGLMaterial;
        mat->setDiffuseColor(Qt::red);
        m_scene->setMaterial(mat);
    }
    \endcode

    Then during rendering the scene is used to display the results:
    \code
    MyView::paintGL(QGLPainter *painter)
    {
        m_scene->draw(painter);
    }
    \endcode

    QGLBuilder automatically generates index values and normals
    on-the-fly during geometry building.  During building, simply send
    primitives to the builder as a sequence of vertices, and
    vertices that are the same will be referenced by a single index
    automatically.

    Primitives will have standard normals generated automatically
    based on vertex winding.

    Consider the following code for OpenGL to draw a quad with corner
    points A, B, C and D :

    \code
    float vertices[12] =
    {
        -1.0, -1.0, -1.0,   // A
        1.0, -1.0, -1.0,    // B
        1.0, 1.0, 1.0,      // C
        -1.0, 1.0, 1.0      // D
    };
    float normals[12] = { 0.0f };
    for (int i = 0; i < 12; i += 3)
    {
        normals[i] = 0.0;
        normals[i+1] = -sqrt(2.0);
        normals[i+2] = sqrt(2.0);
    }
    GLuint indices[6] = {
        0, 1, 2,     // triangle A-B-C
        0, 2, 3      // triangle A-C-D
    };
    glEnableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY);
    glEnableClientState(GL_NORMAL_ARRAY);
    glVertexPointer(3, GL_FLOAT, 0, vertices);
    glNormalPointer(3, GL_FLOAT, 0, normals);
    glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, 6, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, indices);
    \endcode

    With QGLBuilder this code becomes:

    \code
    float vertices[12] =
    {
        -1.0, -1.0, -1.0,   // A
        1.0, -1.0, -1.0,    // B
        1.0, 1.0, 1.0,      // C
        -1.0, 1.0, 1.0      // D
    };
    QGLBuilder quad;
    QGeometryData data;
    data.appendVertexArray(QArray<QVector3D>::fromRawData(
            reinterpret_cast<const QVector3D*>(vertices), 4));
    quad.addQuads(data);
    \endcode

    The data primitive is added to the list, as two triangles, indexed to
    removed the redundant double storage of B & C - just the same as the
    OpenGL code.

    QGLBuilder will also calculate a normal for the quad and apply it
    to the vertices.

    In this trivial example the indices are easily calculated, however
    in more complex geometry it is easy to introduce bugs by trying
    to manually control indices.  Extra work is required to generate,
    track and store the index values correctly.

    Bugs such as trying to index two vertices with different data -
    one with texture data and one without - into one triangle can
    easily result.  The picture becomes more difficult when smoothing
    groups are introduced - see below.

    Using indices is always preferred since it saves space on the GPU,
    and makes the geometry perform faster during application run time.

    \section2 Removing Epsilon Errors

    Where vertices are generated by modelling packages or tools, or
    during computation in code, very frequently rounding errors will
    result in several vertices being generated that are actually
    the same vertex but are seperated by tiny amounts.  At best these
    duplications waste space on the GPU but at worst can introduce
    visual artifacts that mar the image displayed.

    Closing paths, generating solids of rotation, or moving model
    sections out and back can all introduce these types of epsilon
    errors, resulting in "cracks" or artifacts on display.

    QGLBuilder's index generation process uses a fuzzy match that
    coalesces all vertex values at a point - even if they are out by
    a tiny amount - and references them with a single index.

    \section2 Lighting Normals and Null Triangles

    QGLBuilder functions calculate lighting normals, when building
    geometry.  This saves the application programmer from having to write
    code to calculate them.  Normals for each triangle (a, b, c) are
    calculated as the QVector3D::normal(a, b, c).

    If lighting normals are explicitly supplied when using QGLBuilder,
    then this calculation is not done.  This may save on build time.

    As an optimization, QGLBuilder skips null triangles, that is ones
    with zero area, where it can.  Such triangles generate no fragments on
    the GPU, and thus do not display but nonetheless can take up space
    and processing power.

    Null triangles can easily occur when calculating vertices results
    in two vertices coinciding, or three vertices lying on the same line.

    This skipping is done using the lighting normals cross-product.  If the
    cross-product is a null vector then the triangle is null.

    When lighting normals are specified explicitly the skipping
    optimization is suppressed, so if for some reason null triangles are
    required to be retained, then specify normals for each logical vertex,
    or via the QGeometry::setCommonNormal() function.

    See the documentation below of the individual addTriangle() and other
    functions for more details.

    \section2 Raw Triangle Mode

    Where generation of indices and normals is not needed - for example if
    porting an existing application, or where indices and normals result
    naturally; it is possible to do a very fast add of triangles, without
    using any of QGLBuilder's processing.

    Simply ensure that indices are placed in the QGeometryData passed to
    the addTriangle() function, and this will trigger "raw triangle" mode.

    When adding triangles in this way ensure that all appropriate values
    have been correctly set, and that the normals, indices and other data
    are correctly calculated, since no checking is done.

    \section1 Rendering and QGLSceneNode items.

    QGLSceneNodes are used to manage application of local transformations,
    materials and effects.

    QGLBuilder generates a root level QGLSceneNode, which can be accessed
    with the sceneNode() function.  Under this a new node is created for
    each section of geometry, and also by using pushNode() and popNode().

    To organize geometry for painting with different materials and effects
    call the newNode() function:

    \code
    QGLSceneNode *box = builder.newNode();
    box->setMaterial(wood);
    \endcode

    Many nodes may be created this way, but they will be optimized into
    a small number of buffers under the one scene when the
    finalizedSceneNode() function is called.

    \image soup.png

    Here the front can is a set of built geometry and the other two are
    scene nodes that reference it, without copying any geometry.

    \snippet builder/builder.cpp 0

    QGLSceneNodes can be used after the builder is created to cheaply
    copy and redisplay the whole scene.  Or to reference parts of the geometry
    use the functions newNode() or pushNode() and popNode() to manage
    QGLSceneNode generation while building geometry.

    To draw the resulting built geometry simply call the draw method of the
    build geometry.

    \snippet builder/builder.cpp 1

    Call the \l{QGLSceneNode::palette()}{palette()} function on the sceneNode()
    to get the QGLMaterialCollection for the node, and place textures
    and materials into it.

    Built geometry will typically share the one palette.  Either create a
    palette, and pass it to the \l{QGLBuilder::QGLBuilder()}{constructor};
    or pass no arguments to the constructor and the QGLBuilder
    will create a palette:

    \snippet builder/builder.cpp 2

    These may then be applied as needed throughout the building of the
    geometry using the integer reference, \c{canMat} in the above code.

    See the QGLSceneNode documentation for more.

    \section1 Using Sections

    During initialization of the QGLBuilder, while accumulating
    geometry, the geometry data in a QGLBuilder is placed into
    sections - there must be at least one section.

    Call the newSection() function to create a new section:

    \snippet builder/builder.cpp 3

    Here seperate sections for the rounded outside cylinder and flat top and
    bottom of the soup can model makes for the appearance of a sharp edge
    between them.  If the sides and top and bottom were in the same section
    QGLBuilder would attempt to average the normals around the edge resulting
    in an unrealistic effect.

    In 3D applications this concept is referred to as
    \l{http://www.google.com/search?smoothing+groups}{smoothing groups}.  Within
    a section (smoothing group) all normals are averaged making it appear
    as one smoothly shaded surface.

    The can has 3 smoothing groups - bottom, top and sides.

    This mesh of a Q is a faceted model - it has 0 smoothing groups:

    \image faceted-q.png

    To create geometry with a faceted appearance call newSection() with
    an argument of QGL::Faceted thus \c{newSection(QGL::Faceted)}.

    Faceted geometry is suitable for small models, where hard edges are
    desired between every face - a dice, gem or geometric solid for example.

    If no section has been created when geometry is added a new section is
    created automatically.  This section will have its smoothing set
    to QGL::Smooth.

    To create a faceted appearance rather than accepting the automatically
    created section the << operator can also be used:

    \code
    QGLBuilder builder;
    QGeometryData triangles;
    triangles.appendVertices(a, b, c);
    builder << QGL::Faceted << triangles;
    \endcode

    \section2 Geometry Data in a Section

    Management of normals and vertices for smoothing, and other data is
    handled automatically by the QGLBuilder instance.

    Within a section, incoming geometry data will be coalesced and
    indices created to reference the fewest possible copies of the vertex
    data.  For example, in smooth geometry all copies of a vertex are
    coalesced into one, and referenced by indices.

    One of the few exceptions to this is the case where texture data forms
    a \i seam and a copy of a vertex must be created to carry the two
    texture coordinates either side of the seam.

    \image texture-seam.png

    Coalescing has the effect of packing geometry data into the
    smallest space possible thus improving cache coherence and performance.

    Again all this is managed automatically by QGLBuilder and all
    that is required is to create smooth or faceted sections, and add
    geometry to them.

    Each QGLSection references a contiguous range of vertices in a
    QGLBuilder.

    \section1 Finalizing and Retrieving the Scene

    Once the geometry has been accumulated in the QGLBuilder instance,  the
    finalizedSceneNode() method must be called to retrieve the optimized
    scene.  This function serves to normalize the geometry and optimize
    it for display.

    While it may be convenient to get pointers to sub nodes in the scene
    during construction, it is important to retrieve the root of the scene
    so that the memory consumed by the scene can be recovered.  The builder
    will create a QGLMaterialCollection; and there may be geometry, materials
    and other resources: these are all parented onto the root scene node.
    These can easily be recovered by deleting the root scene node:

    \code
    MyView::MyView() : QGLView()
    {
        // in the constructor construct a builder on the stack
        QGLBuilder builder;

        // add geometry as shown above
        builder << triangles;

        // obtain the scene from the builder & take ownership
        m_scene = builder.finalizedSceneNode();
    }

    MyView::~MyView()
    {
        // recover all scene resources
        delete m_scene;
    }
    \endcode

    Alternatively set the scene's parent to ensure resource recovery
    \c{m_scene->setParent(this)}.

    Add a \a triangle or series of triangles to this builder.

    If \a triangle has indices specified then no processing of any kind is

    This "raw triangle" mode is for advanced use, and it is assumed that
    the user knows what they are doing, in particular that the indices
    supplied are correct, and normals are supplied and correct.

    Otherwise, if no indices are supplied, then the list is broken into
    groups of 3 vertices, each processed as a triangle.

    Any vertices at the end of the list under a multiple of 3 are
    ignored.

    If no normals are supplied in \a triangle, a normal is calculated as
    the cross-product \c{(b - a) x (c - a)}, for each group of 3
    logical vertices \c{a(triangle, i), b(triangle, i+1), c(triangle, i+2)}.

    In the case of a degenerate triangle, where the cross-product is null,
    that triangle is skipped.  Supplying normals suppresses this behaviour
    and degenerate triangles will be added to the geometry.

    triangles is likewise not performed.

    Add a series of quads by 'interleaving' \a top and \a bottom.

    This function behaves like quadStrip(), where the odd-numbered vertices in
    the input primitive are from \a top and the even-numbered vertices from
    \a bottom.

    It is trivial to do extrusions using this function:

    \code
    // create a series of quads for an extruded edge
    addQuadsInterleaved(topEdge, topEdge.translated(QVector3D(0, -1, 0));
    \endcode

    N quad faces are generated where \c{N == min(top.count(), bottom.count() - 1}.
    If \a top or \a bottom has less than 2 elements, this functions does
    nothing.

    Each face is formed by the \c{i'th} and \c{(i + 1)'th}
    vertices of \a bottom, followed by the \c{(i + 1)'th} and \c{i'th}
    vertices of \a top.

    If the vertices in \a top and \a bottom are the perimeter vertices of
    two polygons then this function can be used to generate quads which form
    the sides of a \l{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(geometry)}{prism}
    with the polygons as the prisms top and bottom end-faces.

    \image quad-extrude.png

    In the diagram above, the \a top is shown in orange, and the \a bottom in
    dark yellow.  The first generated quad, (a, b, c, d) is generated in
    the order shown by the blue arrow.

    To create such a extruded prismatic solid, complete with top and bottom cap
    polygons, given just the top edge do this:
    \code
    QGeometryData top = buildTopEdge();
    QGeometryData bottom = top.translated(QVector3D(0, 0, -1));
    builder.addQuadsInterleaved(top, bottom);
    builder.addTriangulatedFace(top);
    builder.addTriangulatedFace(bottom.reversed());
    \endcode
    The \a bottom QGeometryData must be \bold{reversed} so that the correct
    winding for an outward facing polygon is obtained.

    The root node will have a child node for each section that was created

    This method must be called exactly once after building the scene.

    Calling code takes ownership of the scene.  If this builder is destroyed

    second and subsequent calls a warning is printed and NULL is returned.

    may be deleted or go out of scope while the scene lives on:

    \code
