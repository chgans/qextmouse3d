    \class QGLTextureSpecifier
    \brief The QGLTextureSpecifier class manages incremental texture geometry.
    \since 4.6
    \ingroup qt3d
    \ingroup qt3d::geometry

    The QGLTextureSpecifier class encapsulates texture coordinates for the
    purpose of applying them to geometry.

    The texture coordinates can be set on an individual basis for all four
    corners of the texture-mapping.  By default the coordinates are all zero,
    and the specifier is null - that is isNull() returns true.

    In the simplest case the entire texture is applied to a quad:
    \code
    // origin 0, 0 and width x height of 1 x 1
    QGLTextureSpecifier texSpec(0, 0, 1, 1);
    myDisplayList.appendQuad(a, b, c, d, texSpec);
    \endcode

    To apply a sequence of texture coordinate sets, where the values of the
    coordinates are interpolated and tiled across incrementally, over
    the faces being textured, use startTileRight() and tileRight().  Here
    two faces \c{a-b-c-d} and \c{b-e-f-c} are adjacent, sharing edge \c{b-c}.
    The first faces width is 1, and the second faces width is 2.  The
    texture will be split and tiled across the faces 1/3 and 2/3.
    \code
    // origin 0, 0 and width x height of 1 x 1
    QGLTextureSpecifier texSpec(0, 0, 1, 1);
    texSpec.startTileRight(3.0f);
    myDisplayList.appendQuad(a, b, c, d, texSpec.tileRight(2.0f));
    myDisplayList.appendQuad(b, e, f, c, texSpec.tileRight(1.0f));
    \endcode
