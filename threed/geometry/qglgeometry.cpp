    \class QGLGeometry
    \brief The QGLGeometry class provides storage for geometry meshes.
    \since 4.6
    \ingroup qt3d
    \ingroup qt3d::geometry

    QGLGeometry provides facilities for applications to build
    up sets of triangles, quads, lines, etc, for drawing with
    QGLPainter::draw().  The geometry can be built on the fly while
    objects are being drawn, or built ahead of time and then cached
    until needed.

    The following example builds up a set of triangles:

    \code
    QGLGeometry geom;
    geom.setDrawingMode(QGL::Triangles);
    geom.setVertexArray(vertices);

    QGLPainter painter(this);
    geom.draw(&painter);
    \endcode

    Subclasses of QGLGeometry can specialize for certain kinds of
    objects: cubes, spheres, teapots, etc.  The constructors for
    the subclasses populate the vertexArray() of QGLGeometry
    with the actual geometry.  For example, the following draws a
    unit cube at the origin:

    \code
    QGLCube cube;
    cube.draw(&painter);
    \endcode

    QGLGeometry objects can be cached in the GL server as vertex
    buffers, which allows them to be more quickly rendered.
    Vertex buffers are uploaded to the GL server by calling upload():

    \code
    cube.upload();
    \endcode

    If the number of vertices in the QGLGeometry object is
    greater than or equal to bufferThreshold(), then a vertex
    buffer will be created automatically the first time draw()
    is called.
